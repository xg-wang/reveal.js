				<section>
					<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Logs are important
							<p>
								> Especially for Big Data environment where other software debugging techniques are difficult to be applied.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Although important, log-based problem identification is not easy.
							<p>
								> Especially by manually examining a huge number of log messages.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

						<h3>ICSE’13 approach has limitations</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Precision is still rather low (range from 10% to 38%)</strong>
							</li>
							<p>It does not consider the potential similarity between two log sequences when they are not repetition or permutation of each other.</p>
							<p>⇒ Add weiting to vectorization.</p>
							<p>But log sequences are highly diverse and log events are not equal in importance.</p>
							<em> > “E1, E2, E3, E3, E5, E6” and “E1, E3, E5, E2, E6” are reduced to be the same</em>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Not utilizing the previous known failures</strong>
							</li>
							<p>ICSE’13 approach requires the engineers to examine <strong>all</strong> delta sequences.</p>
							<p>Many of the failures are <strong>recurrent</strong> ones, whose mitigations/resolutions are already known to the engineers and whose corresponding logs need not to be examined again.</p>
							<p>⇒ Update knowledge base to alleviate the efforts.</p>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Log Cluster</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Utilizes the characteristics of logs of online service systems to facilitate log- based problem identification.</li>
							<li>Addresses the limitations of the previous approaches and <strong>outperforms</strong> them.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>The Approach</h2>
						<img width="682" data-src="assets/overview.png" alt="overview">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Major steps</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Log Vectorization:</strong> Turn each log sequence into a vector.</li>
							<li><strong>Log Clustering:</strong> Calculate the similarity value between two log sequences and group the similar log sequences into clusters.</li>
							<li><strong>Extracting Representative Log Sequence:</strong> Select a representative log sequence from each cluster by choosing the centroid of the cluster.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Checking Recurrence</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<ol>
							<li>Checks if a representative log sequence appears before by querying a knowledge base.</li>
							<li>The knowledge base is also updated with the new clusters.</li>
						</ol>

						<h3>Log Vectorization</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Parse free-form raw log messages using log abstraction</li>
							<li>Produces log sequences by deduplicating and linking same ID</li>
							<li>Weighting with <strong>Inverse Document Frequency</strong> and <strong>Contrast</strong>: \[w(t) = 0.5 × Norm(w_{idf}(t)) + 0.5 × w_{con}(t)\]</li>
						</ol>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p class="left-text">
							After calculating the weight for each event, we can represent a log sequence as a vector of weight in an N-dimensional space.

					<h3>Log Clustering</h3>
					<p>(Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering)</p>
					<img width="590" data-src="assets/clustering.png" alt="clustering">
					\[Similarity(S_i, S_j) = \frac{S_i \cdot \S_j}{\|S_i\|\|S_j\|}\]
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Extracting Representative Log Sequence</h3>
					<p class="left-text">Compute the score of each log sequence i in a cluster based on its average distance to other log sequences in the same cluster:</p>
					\[Score(i) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum^{n}_{j=1}(1 − Similarity(S_i, S_j))\]
					<p class="left-text">Select the log sequence with the minimal score for manual examination.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Checking Recurrence</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Select representative log sequence of the new cluster.</li>
						<li>Use same cosine similarity measure with existing knowledge base.</li>
						<li>If recurrent and corresponds to a known failure, the associated mitigation actions are retrieved from the knowledge base.</li>
						<li>New representative is returned for manual examination and update the knowledge base.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Experiments</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Same application: WordCount, PageRank</li>
						<li>Two addition Microsoft Services added(X and Y).</li>
						<li>Collect: Hadoop logs, MS services logs (3.3m from X, 10m from Y)</li>
						<li>Hardware: A cluster with 46 cores across ﬁve machines. Each PC has Intel(R) Core(TM) i7- 3770 CPU and 16GB RAM.</li>
					</ul>

						<h2>Results</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>RQ1: How much effort reduction does LogCluster achieve?</li>
							<li>RQ2: How accurate is LogCluster in identifying problems?</li>
							<li>RQ3: The impact of the distance threshold</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Discussion and Lessons Learned</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Log Severity Levels</h3>
						<ul style="font-size: 0.8em">
							<li>For logs generated by Microsoft Product K, only a small percentage (<10%) of high severe logs are related to the actual system failures, and many (>30%) failures are associated with logs that have low severity levels.</li>
							<li>A failure that is considered critical to one component may not affect the whole distributed system.</li>
							<li>⇒LogCluster does not rely on log severity levels. It is based on abstraction and clustering of log sequences, therefore avoiding the limitations of using log severity levels.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Permutations of a Log Sequence</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Means: <em>“E1, E2, E3, E5, E6”</em> and <em>“E1, E3, E5, E2, E6”</em> are same.</li>
							<li>Multithreading service causes interleaving logs even for the same user request.</li>
							<li>⇒Both ICSE’13 work and this paper do not consider permutations.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Deployment Failures of Online Service Systems</h3>
						<ul style="font-size: 0.8em">
							<li>Online service system initially launched, many failures are related tofunctional features.</li>
							<li>When stable, deployment failures account for a large percentage of failures of online service systems, such as issues in network connection, DNS, configuration, hardware, etc.</li>
							<li>Using LogCluster, developers can quickly detect the recurrent deployment failures and find mitigation solutions from the knowledge base,</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Analysis of LogCluster</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Log parsing accounts for a large portion of computation time of LogCluster. <br>
							⇒ Good practice to directly add a log event ID.</li>
							<li>Log data is huge: TB or PB per day. THe log analysis itself is computed distributly<br>
							⇒ Select <strong>Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm</strong> rather than <em>K-Means, K-Medoids, DBSCAN</em></li>
						</ul>
